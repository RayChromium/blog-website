It's not anything too serious; it's just a collection of book/movie reviews, travel diaries, some anecdotes from daily life, and my own reflections. I don't expect a lot of people to visit this website; it's mainly a way for me to improve my thinking skills and communication abilities through practicing writing and speaking. However, if my shared content can be helpful to you, that would be even better."
